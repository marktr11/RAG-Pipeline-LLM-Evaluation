# Part 2 â€“ Evaluation Methodology

This section outlines the proposed methodology for evaluating the quality of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) responses. Our approach is a four-step iterative pipeline designed for comprehensive assessment and continuous improvement.

**For a detailed explanation of each step, including specific metrics, tools, and the underlying rationale, please refer to the complete methodology document: [Detailed RAG Evaluation Pipeline](./EVALUATION.pdf)**

The core stages of our evaluation pipeline are:

1.  **System Definition & Metric Selection:**
    *   Defining RAG variants and selecting key quality and hallucination metrics.
2.  **Evaluation:**
    *   Assessing retrieval impact and benchmarking response quality & hallucination.
3.  **Iterative Refinement via Deep Error Analysis:**
    *   Systematic metric logging, meticulous failure analysis (automated & manual), and guiding component adjustments.
4.  **Final Validation:**
    *   Unbiased performance assessment on a holdout set, confirming overall quality and real-world efficacy.

We believe this structured approach ensures a robust and reliable evaluation, leading to more trustworthy RAG systems. For the full details, please consult the linked document above.
