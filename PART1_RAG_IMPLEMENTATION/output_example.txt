evaluation methods. Recent studies have shown that this idea can merges the scalability of automatic
methods with the detailed, context-sensitive reasoning found in expert judgments [19, 81, 163, 210,
220]. Moreover, LLMs may become sufficiently flexible to handle multimodal inputs [ 18] under
appropriate prompt learning or fine-tuning [64]. These advantages suggest that the LLM-as-a-Judge
approach could serve as a novel and broadly applicable paradigm for addressing complex and
open-ended evaluation problems.
LLM-as-a-Judge holds significant potential as a scalable and adaptable evaluation framework
compared to aforementioned two traditional methods [160]. However, the widespread application
of this idea is hindered by two key challenges. The first challenge lies in the absence of a systematic
review, which highlights the lack of formal definitions, fragmented understanding, and inconsistent
usage practices in the relevant studies. As a result, researchers and practitioners struggle to
fully understand and apply effectively. The second challenge involves addressing concerns about
reliability [189], as merely employing LLM-as-a-Judge does not ensure accurate evaluations aligned
with established standards. These challenges emphasize the need for a deeper assessment of the
outputs generated by LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as a crucial investigation into the question: How to
build reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems?

ensuring robustness is another critical concern. LLM-as-a-Judge can be susceptible to adversarial
prompt manipulation and contextual framing biases, potentially causing unintended or unreliable
evaluations. Finally, generalization across domains and modalities remains a significant hurdle, as
current models struggle with evaluating multi-modal inputs, reasoning over structured data, and
adapting to domain-specific evaluation standards.
To address these challenges, future research should focus on three key areas. First, improving
reliability requires advancements in self-consistency mechanisms, uncertainty calibration, and bias
mitigation techniques, ensuring that models provide stable and well-calibrated judgments. Second,
enhancing robustness involves developing adversarial-resistant evaluation frameworks and refining
prompt engineering methodologies, reducing sensitivity to context variations. Third, expanding
generalization capabilities calls for advancing multi-modal reasoning, integrating structured knowl-
edge representations, and refining domain-adaptive learning strategies, allowing models to handle
diverse evaluation scenarios more effectively.
Ultimately, LLM-as-a-Judge is poised to become an integral component of next-generation evalu-
ation systems, augmenting human expertise rather than replacing it. By addressing the challenges
of reliability, robustness, and generalization, we can create more trustworthy, adaptive, and compre-

Moreover, LLMs as evaluators demonstrate significant advantages in qualitative assessments
that are difficult to quantify, such as evaluating service quality, analyzing user experience feedback,
and assessing creative content like art or literature reviews. LLMs’ capability to understand and
generate nuanced language makes them well-suited for subjective evaluation tasks traditionally
requiring human judgment. Future research will focus more on these areas, exploring how LLMs as
judges can enhance assessment accuracy and consistency where traditional quantitative methods
fall short.
8 CHALLENGES
In this chapter, we explore the key challenges that arise when utilizing LLMs for evaluation
tasks, particularly in the context of LLM-as-a-Judge. Despite their growing capabilities, LLMs still
face significant issues related to reliability, robustness, and their backbone models’ limitations.
Understanding these challenges is crucial for advancing the use of LLMs in a fair, consistent, and
reliable manner. We address these concerns under three main themes: reliability, robustness, and
the need for more powerful backbone models.
8.1 Reliability
Evaluating the reliability of LLMs when used as judges reveals several pressing challenges. Both
human and LLM judges exhibit biases, which raises concerns regarding the consistency and fairness
of their evaluations. Specifically, human judges are also found to have inherent bias [170, 210] and

Generated Answer:
The two main challenges hindering the widespread application of the 'LLM-as-a-Judge' approach are the lack of a systematic review, leading to fragmented understanding and inconsistent practices, and concerns about reliability, as LLMs may not ensure accurate evaluations aligned with established standards. These issues emphasize the need for deeper assessments of LLM outputs and the development of reliable systems. Addressing these challenges is crucial for enhancing the trustworthiness and effectiveness of LLMs in evaluation tasks.
