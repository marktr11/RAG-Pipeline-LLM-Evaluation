ensuring robustness is another critical concern. LLM-as-a-Judge can be susceptible to adversarial
prompt manipulation and contextual framing biases, potentially causing unintended or unreliable
evaluations. Finally, generalization across domains and modalities remains a significant hurdle, as
current models struggle with evaluating multi-modal inputs, reasoning over structured data, and
adapting to domain-specific evaluation standards.
To address these challenges, future research should focus on three key areas. First, improving
reliability requires advancements in self-consistency mechanisms, uncertainty calibration, and bias
mitigation techniques, ensuring that models provide stable and well-calibrated judgments. Second,
enhancing robustness involves developing adversarial-resistant evaluation frameworks and refining
prompt engineering methodologies, reducing sensitivity to context variations. Third, expanding
generalization capabilities calls for advancing multi-modal reasoning, integrating structured knowl-
edge representations, and refining domain-adaptive learning strategies, allowing models to handle
diverse evaluation scenarios more effectively.
Ultimately, LLM-as-a-Judge is poised to become an integral component of next-generation evalu-
ation systems, augmenting human expertise rather than replacing it. By addressing the challenges
of reliability, robustness, and generalization, we can create more trustworthy, adaptive, and compre-

7.2.2 Law. LLMs have shown growing capabilities in providing professional advice in specialized
fields such as legal consultation, particularly excelling in tasks like text summarization and legal
reasoning. However, compared to other fields, the legal sector is more concerned about potential
biases and factual inaccuracies within LLMs. Similar to the finance domain, existing research in

evaluation methods. Recent studies have shown that this idea can merges the scalability of automatic
methods with the detailed, context-sensitive reasoning found in expert judgments [19, 81, 163, 210,
220]. Moreover, LLMs may become sufficiently flexible to handle multimodal inputs [ 18] under
appropriate prompt learning or fine-tuning [64]. These advantages suggest that the LLM-as-a-Judge
approach could serve as a novel and broadly applicable paradigm for addressing complex and
open-ended evaluation problems.
LLM-as-a-Judge holds significant potential as a scalable and adaptable evaluation framework
compared to aforementioned two traditional methods [160]. However, the widespread application
of this idea is hindered by two key challenges. The first challenge lies in the absence of a systematic
review, which highlights the lack of formal definitions, fragmented understanding, and inconsistent
usage practices in the relevant studies. As a result, researchers and practitioners struggle to
fully understand and apply effectively. The second challenge involves addressing concerns about
reliability [189], as merely employing LLM-as-a-Judge does not ensure accurate evaluations aligned
with established standards. These challenges emphasize the need for a deeper assessment of the
outputs generated by LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as a crucial investigation into the question: How to
build reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems?

Generated Answer:
The two main challenges hindering the widespread application of the 'LLM-as-a-Judge' approach are the lack of a systematic review, leading to fragmented understanding and inconsistent practices, and concerns about reliability, as using LLMs does not guarantee accurate evaluations. These issues create difficulties for researchers and practitioners in effectively applying the approach. Addressing these challenges is essential for developing reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems.
