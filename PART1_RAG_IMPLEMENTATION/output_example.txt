compared to aforementioned two traditional methods [160]. However, the widespread application
of this idea is hindered by two key challenges. The first challenge lies in the absence of a systematic
review, which highlights the lack of formal definitions, fragmented understanding, and inconsistent
usage practices in the relevant studies. As a result, researchers and practitioners struggle to
fully understand and apply effectively. The second challenge involves addressing concerns about
reliability [189], as merely employing LLM-as-a-Judge does not ensure accurate evaluations aligned
with established standards. These challenges emphasize the need for a deeper assessment of the
outputs generated by LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as a crucial investigation into the question: How to
build reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems?
To address these challenges, this paper provides a systematic review of research on LLM-as-a-
Judge. It offers a comprehensive overview of the field and explores strategies for building reliable
LLM-as-a-Judge systems. We begin by defining LLM-as-a-Judge through both formal and informal

are discussed in Sections 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Notably, in Section 6, we discuss the synergy
between LLM-as-a-Judge and o1-like reasoning enhancement, where dynamic feedback is used to
optimize reasoning paths and significantly improve the model’s ability to solve complex problems.
Section 7 explores practical applications, while Sections 8 and 9 address challenges and outline
future research directions. Finally, Section 10 presents our conclusions.

The negative effects of concreteness bias arises from the neglect of the factual correctness of
these details, thereby encouraging hallucination [1].
4.2.3 Challenges. To advance the development of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, future efforts should
address two key challenges: (i) Need for Systematic Benchmark . Due to the diversity of biases, it is
crucial to propose a systematic benchmark to evaluate the extent of various biases. As shown in
Table 1, EVALBIASBENCH [111] was proposed as a test set to measure six types of bias. Other work
[186] is dedicated to proposing a unified bias testing process, including automated perturbation and
a unified metric. They constructed a bias quantification framework CALM, which covers 12 types
of bias. Despite these efforts, there is still no systematic benchmark and dataset that includes all
types of biases. (ii) Challenges of Controlled Study. When conducting an investigation into a certain
type of bias, it is challenging to isolate the specific direction of interest from other biases and
quality-related characteristics. For instance, in the case of position bias, lengthening the response

Despite these strengths, several challenges must be addressed to fully realize its potential.
Ensuring reliability remains a key issue, because probabilistic outputs can introduce inconsistencies,
overconfidence, and biases inherited from training data. Although techniques RLHF have improved
alignment with human judgment, they do not eliminate all sources of subjectivity. Moreover,
ensuring robustness is another critical concern. LLM-as-a-Judge can be susceptible to adversarial
prompt manipulation and contextual framing biases, potentially causing unintended or unreliable
evaluations. Finally, generalization across domains and modalities remains a significant hurdle, as
current models struggle with evaluating multi-modal inputs, reasoning over structured data, and
adapting to domain-specific evaluation standards.
To address these challenges, future research should focus on three key areas. First, improving
reliability requires advancements in self-consistency mechanisms, uncertainty calibration, and bias
mitigation techniques, ensuring that models provide stable and well-calibrated judgments. Second,

To address these challenges, this paper provides a systematic review of research on LLM-as-a-
Judge. It offers a comprehensive overview of the field and explores strategies for building reliable
LLM-as-a-Judge systems. We begin by defining LLM-as-a-Judge through both formal and informal
definitions, answering the foundational question: "What is LLM-as-a-Judge?" Next, we categorize
existing methods and approaches, exploring "How to use LLM-as-a-Judge?" . Following this, to
tackle the critical question: "How to build reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems?" , we explore two core
aspects: (1) strategies to enhance the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems and (2) methodologies
for evaluating the reliability of these systems. For the first aspect, we review key strategies to
optimize the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge. For the second aspect, we examine the metrics,
datasets, and methodologies used to evaluate LLM-as-a-Judge systems, highlighting potential
sources of bias and methods for their mitigation. Building on this, we introduce a novel benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating LLM-as-a-Judge systems. Additionally, we explore practical

2 BACKGROUND AND METHOD
The capacity of LLMs to emulate human reasoning and evaluate specific inputs against a set of
predefined rules has paved the way for "LLM-as-a-Judge. " Existing studies indicate that LLM’s
scalability, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness make them well-suited for managing a growing
number of evaluative tasks that were traditionally done by humans. These abilities are key in
utilizing LLMs flexibly across various evaluation scenarios and objectives. As a result, adoption
of LLM in evaluation has progressed rapidly in practice. Initially, the primary focus of LLMs
was on language generation and comprehension. With advancements in training paradigms like
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [108], LLMs became increasingly aligned
with human values and reasoning processes. This alignment has allowed LLMs to transition from
generative tasks to evaluative roles. At its core, LLM-as-a-Judge denotes the use of LLMs to evaluate
objects, actions, or decisions based on predefined rules, criteria, or preferences. It encompasses a
broad spectrum of roles, including:Graders [31, 154], Evaluators/Assessors [82, 196], Critics [63,

that are difficult to quantify, such as evaluating service quality, analyzing user experience feedback,
and assessing creative content like art or literature reviews. LLMs’ capability to understand and
generate nuanced language makes them well-suited for subjective evaluation tasks traditionally
requiring human judgment. Future research will focus more on these areas, exploring how LLMs as
judges can enhance assessment accuracy and consistency where traditional quantitative methods
fall short.
8 CHALLENGES
In this chapter, we explore the key challenges that arise when utilizing LLMs for evaluation
tasks, particularly in the context of LLM-as-a-Judge. Despite their growing capabilities, LLMs still
face significant issues related to reliability, robustness, and their backbone models’ limitations.
Understanding these challenges is crucial for advancing the use of LLMs in a fair, consistent, and
reliable manner. We address these concerns under three main themes: reliability, robustness, and
the need for more powerful backbone models.

surface-level lexical overlaps, often fail to capture deeper nuances, resulting in poor performance
in tasks like story generation or instructional texts [124]. As a solution to this persistent dilemma,
“LLM-as-a-Judge” has emerged as a promising idea to combine the strengths of the above two
evaluation methods. Recent studies have shown that this idea can merges the scalability of automatic
methods with the detailed, context-sensitive reasoning found in expert judgments [19, 81, 163, 210,
220]. Moreover, LLMs may become sufficiently flexible to handle multimodal inputs [ 18] under
appropriate prompt learning or fine-tuning [64]. These advantages suggest that the LLM-as-a-Judge
approach could serve as a novel and broadly applicable paradigm for addressing complex and
open-ended evaluation problems.
LLM-as-a-Judge holds significant potential as a scalable and adaptable evaluation framework
compared to aforementioned two traditional methods [160]. However, the widespread application
of this idea is hindered by two key challenges. The first challenge lies in the absence of a systematic
review, which highlights the lack of formal definitions, fragmented understanding, and inconsistent

Generated Answer:
The two main challenges hindering the widespread application of the 'LLM-as-a-Judge' approach are the absence of a systematic review and concerns about reliability. The lack of formal definitions and fragmented understanding makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to effectively apply this method. Additionally, issues related to the accuracy of evaluations and potential biases further complicate its implementation.
