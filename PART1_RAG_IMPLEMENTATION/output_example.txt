A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge
2 BACKGROUND AND METHOD
The capacity of LLMs to emulate human reasoning and evaluate specific inputs against a set of
predefined rules has paved the way for "LLM-as-a-Judge. " Existing studies indicate that LLM’s
scalability, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness make them well-suited for managing a growing
number of evaluative tasks that were traditionally done by humans. These abilities are key in
utilizing LLMs flexibly across various evaluation scenarios and objectives. As a result, adoption
of LLM in evaluation has progressed rapidly in practice. Initially, the primary focus of LLMs
was on language generation and comprehension. With advancements in training paradigms like
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [108], LLMs became increasingly aligned
with human values and reasoning processes. This alignment has allowed LLMs to transition from
generative tasks to evaluative roles. At its core, LLM-as-a-Judge denotes the use of LLMs to evaluate
objects, actions, or decisions based on predefined rules, criteria, or preferences. It encompasses a
broad spectrum of roles, including:Graders [31, 154], Evaluators/Assessors [82, 196], Critics [63,
112, 175], Verifiers [90, 131, 166], Examiners [9], Reward/Ranking Models [100, 139, 180, 193],
etc.
Currently, the definition of how to effectively use LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluation tasks is largely
informal or vague, lacking clear and formal expression. Therefore, we will start with a formal

Generated Answer:
The two main challenges hindering the widespread application of the 'LLM-as-a-Judge' approach are reliability and robustness. There are concerns about potential biases and factual inaccuracies within LLMs, particularly in sensitive fields like law and finance. Additionally, the lack of clear and formal definitions for effectively using LLMs in evaluative roles complicates their implementation.
